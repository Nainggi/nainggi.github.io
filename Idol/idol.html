       <b>Early Life</b>
        <br><br>
Özil[6] was born on 15 October 1988[7] in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, as a son of Turkish immigrants.[8] His grandfather moved as a Gastarbeiter from Zonguldak, Turkey to Germany.[9] He played, at youth level, for various clubs in Gelsenkirchen during 1995~2000, before a five-year stint for Rot-Weiss Essen.[citati

        <b>Schalke</b>
        <br><br>
    
        In 2005, Özil moved to the youth system of Schalke 04. He was deployed a midfielder and wore 17 as his squad number, after starting as a playmaker and central attacking midfielder in the place of the suspended Lincoln in DFL-Ligapokal matches against Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich.[10] Upon making the first team at Schalke, he was described as "the next big thing". However, soon after declining an offer from Schalke 04, claiming that a yearly salary of €1.5 million would not be enough, he eventually fell out with club management and moved on to Werder Bremen in January 2008.[11] This led to Mirko Slomka, the then-Schalke manager, claiming that Özil would not play another match for Schalke.

Özil taking a free kick for Arsenal in 2013
On 2 September 2013, Özil agreed to join English side Arsenal.[41] Both the fee paid for Özil as well as the contract duration were undisclosed, but they are believed to be around £42.5 million (€50 million) for a five-year deal.[42] The transfer makes him the most expensive German football player of all time.[43] Özil was assigned the number 11 shirt and the centre-attacking midfield role by the team.[44] Contract leaks in January 2016, however, have revealed that the record fee was actually broken down to £37.4 million (€44 million) with a further £5.1 million (€6 million) split evenly over six years from July 2014, subject to Champions League qualification. A buy-back option also allows Real Madrid a 48-hour first option on Özil should Arsenal agree a sale for the playmaker to another Spanish club.[45]
